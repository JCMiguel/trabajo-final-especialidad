\section{Rapid Review research protocol} \label{section:en/protocolo}

This section describes the research protocol used for this rapid review. Rapid Reviews (RR) are practice-oriented secondary studies, and their main goal is to provide evidence to support decision-making towards the solution, or at least attenuation, of issues practitioners face in practice \cite{Cartaxo2020}.

For this Rapid Review, the PRISMA \cite{Tricco2019} methodology was used for reference. The research question for the case study of this work, the repositories used for the search, the search process and search string, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the selection process are specified as follows.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Research Question}

The Research Question to be answered is the following: \emph{What are the main factors that limit the implementation of AI/xAI in histopathology?} Considering all of the impediments reported so far will permit to gather all of the known and necessary requirements to implement AI/xAI in histopathology.

\subsection{Search Process and Search string}

An automatic search in the ACM, IEEE Xplore, PubMed and Springer digital libraries and platforms was conducted. The search included publications between January 2015 and June 2023.

For the construction of the search string, the main terms “explainable artificial intelligence”, “histopathology”, “histology” and “anatomic pathology” were considered, including their alternative terms. The resulting search string is presented in Figure \ref{figura:en/cadena_generica}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\subsection{Selection process}

The study selection process consisted of ten steps, which were executed sequentially. Details about the process are described in Table \ref{tabla:en/proceso_busqueda}. This process allowed the selection of the primary studies that were analyzed to answer the research question.

\subsection{Data Extraction process}

This section presents the search performed in the digital libraries and platforms. The search string was applied in the libraries with some necessary adjustments depending on the particularities of each one. Figure \ref{figura:en/data_extraction} shows the articles search and selection process.
