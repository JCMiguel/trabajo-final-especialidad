Explainability is considered one of the prerequisites for AI in medicine. In this sense, xAI is seen as a step towards the realization of the FATE principles in AI \cite{ShabanNejad2021}.

Holzinger et al. \cite{Holzinger2019} propose that it is necessary to understand the causality of representations. This is why they differentiate the words “explainability” and “causality”. Explainability highlights decision-relevant parts of the used representations of the algorithms and active parts in the algorithmic model and it does not refer to an explicit human model. Causability is defined as the extent to which an explanation of a statement to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding in a specified context of use. Establishing causability as a solid scientific field becomes imperative in this sense.
