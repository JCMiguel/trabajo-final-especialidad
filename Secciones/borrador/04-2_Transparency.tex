% Transparencia, interpretabilidad, causability

Explainability is considered one of the prerequisites for AI in medicine. En este sentido, se considera a xAI como a step towards the realization of the FATE principles in AI \cite{wip}.

Holzinger et al. [PS9] proponen que is necessary to understand the causality of representations. En este sentido, diferencia las palabras "explainability" y "causality". Explainability highlights decision-relevant parts of the used representations of the algorithms and active parts in the algorithmic model and it does not refer to an explicit human model. Por su parte, se define causability as the extent to which an explanation of a statement to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding in a specified context of use. Se destaca la necesidad de establish causability as a solid scientific field.

% Explainability is considered one of the prerequisites [4] for deep medicine, where AI is meant “to provide composite, panoramic views of individuals’ medical data; to improve decision-making; to avoid errors such as misdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures; to help in the ordering and interpretation of appropriate tests, and to recommend treatment” [5].
% FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) [10] principles in AI.

% Methods and models are necessary to reenact the machine decision-making process, to reproduce and to comprehend both the learning and knowledge extraction process. This is important, because for decision support it is necessary to understand the causality of learned representations (Gershman, Horvitz, & Tenenbaum, 2015; Pearl, 2009; Peters, Janzing, & Schölkopf, 2017).
% explainable-AI calls for confidence, safety, security, privacy, ethics, fairness and trust (Kieseberg, Weippl, & Holzinger, 2016), and brings usability (Holzinger, 2005) and Human-AI Interaction into a new and important focus (Miller, Howe, & Sonenberg, 2017). All these aspects together are crucial for applicability in medicine generally, and for future personalized medicine, in particular (Hamburg & Collins, 2010).
% Explainability in a technical sense highlights decision-relevant parts of the used representations of the algorithms and active parts in the algorithmic model, that either contribute to the model accuracy on the training set, or to a specific prediction for one particular observation. It does not refer to an explicit human model.
% Causability as the extent to which an explanation of a statement to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use.
% The establishment of causability as a solid scientific field can help here.
